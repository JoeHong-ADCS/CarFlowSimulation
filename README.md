# CarFlowSimulation
Objective: 
  Simulate car flow and random traffic jam when multiple car on a one way path with different acceleration.
Description: 
  * This is a simple project for practicing program with multithread.
  * There're three threads:
      one for printf graph on cmd window periodically
      one for generating car object randomly
      one for updating each car object's position with its own acceleration
  * It's now with simple idea for slowing down when distance with front car is within a certain range, than accelerate randomly.
